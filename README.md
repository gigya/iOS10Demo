A pod file is included in the Sample application project, which configures Gigya, Facebook, Google and WeChat native SDKs. For the purpose of this demo, a test Gigya API key, Facebook, Google and WeChat application keys are being used from a test account. Please do not use in Production codes - as this project is for demo purposes only.<br/>
